Running and sharing studies online
=======================================

Online studies are realized via `PsychoJS <https://github.com/psychopy/psychojs>`_; the online counterpart of |PsychoPy|. To run your study online, these are the basic steps:

* Check the :ref:`features supported by PsychoJS <onlineStatus>` to ensure the components you need will work online.
* Make your experiment in :ref:`Builder <builder>`.
* :ref:`Configure the online settings <configureOnline>` of your experiment.
* :ref:`Launch your study on Pavlovia.org <usingPavlovia>`.

When making an experiment to run online, there are a few important considerations to make and we **highly** recommend reading through the considerations below, as they could save a lot of time in the long run!

* Using :ref:`resources <handlingOnlineResources>` in online studies.
* :ref:`Multisession testing, Counterbalancing, checking existing IDs, multiplayer games and in-game leaderboard <usingShelf>`.
* :ref:`Caveats and cautions <onlineCaveats>` (timing accuracy and web-browser support).

The first generation of PsychoJS was realized by a `Wellcome Trust <https://wellcome.org/>`_ grant, awarded in January 2018.  to make online studies possible from |PsychoPy|. This is what we call PsychoPy3 - the 3rd major phase of PsychoPy's development.
